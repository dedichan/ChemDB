# ChemDB
#####_Chemicals DataBase for laboratories._
ChemDB is a very easy to use software wich allow you to manage your chemical database.
Most of the laboratories at universities use an archaic Excel file to manage their chemicals. But most of them are not up to date and inventories can be very difficult. With ChemDB, you can import your data from an Excel file to ChemDB's database. Moreover, you can reverse the data to an Excel file.

## Installing ChemDB
### One Client or "Server" ?
ChemDB is mostly used to be a single client with a single software wich mean you cannot really use it with multiple posts and one server. But if you put your database in a dropbox or an equivalent system or an ftp server, you will be able to connect a single database with multiple clients
